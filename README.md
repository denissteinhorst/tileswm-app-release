## Getting Started

1. Launch TilesWM. On first run, macOS will prompt for Accessibility permissions — allow access so TilesWM can move/resize windows and listen for hotkeys.
2. Follow the Personal Setup Assistant to learn the basics quickly.
3. Create or import a Profile. Use the Pixel‑Perfect Editor to tweak tiles exactly as you like.
4. Drag windows to snap into tiles. Enable Always‑Active Mode for automatic snapping; hold the deactivation key to place windows freely when needed.
